Tae computed the photo-z calibration of Sigma_inverse_crit from MOF. The routine ```do_interpolation.py``` finds the calibration at the redshifts of our lens samples.

Also, the file sigma_crit_inv.txt is here. This contains the sigma_crit_inverses for each bin. Errors are discarded because the measurement is precise at the 0.1% level.
